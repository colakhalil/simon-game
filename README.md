# simon-game
The Simon game is a classic memory game where players need to remember and repeat a series of colors and sounds. This project is an interactive implementation of the Simon game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The game consists of a circular game board divided into four colored sections: red, blue, green, and yellow. Each section represents a different sound and color combination. The game starts with a random color sequence being displayed by illuminating the sections in a specific order.

The objective of the game is for the player to repeat the sequence correctly by clicking on the corresponding colored sections. The game keeps track of the player's score and increases the difficulty by adding one additional color to the sequence after each successful round.
